- implement kernel functions.
- implement c99 and c++17 runtimes.
- implement an easy to use desktop.
- make a program permission system.
- maybe some other useful stuff?
- 64-bit long mode.
- Touch screen support (Missing the needed ports to communicate using the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)).
- A fully working GUI Toolkit that implements 100% of gdiplus capabilities with wrapper methods to allow Windows Code to just Work:tm: without changes.
- Full .NET Core 3.0 support with Windows Forms and WPF. WPF Implies that I need some way to wrap DirectX stuff somehow and use open source alternatives on the back end?
- Full Win32 and Win64 Executable support. This would mean I would need some way to resolve Windows DLL's by wrappers for all of them which calls kernel functions that does the same (or similar) things.
